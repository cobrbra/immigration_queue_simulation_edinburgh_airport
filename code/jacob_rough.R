### Suggested changes I've made:
# - I've removed some comments I would describe as 'over-commenting', e.g. "initialising variables",
# "looping over passengers", etc. The general principle being that comments are necessary when the code 
# itself isn't self-explanatory, and that if things like "I'm assigning initial variables" or "I'm looping over 
#Â passengers" aren't clear from code, then that's something that should be rectified in the code naming and 
# structure. The best code commenting is well-written code etc etc etc...
# - I've standardised variable naming to be snake_case. There's no particular reason for this, and in R camelCase 
# is arguably more standard, but picking a naming convention is nice.
# - I've added plurals to variables storing a plural number, e.g. "n_desk" -> "n_desks"
# - I've renamed 'mu_' variables to be more descriptive.
# - I've moved function definitions to the top of the file (since they're effectively forming a new 'library', 
# they should be with other library imports or called from an external source file)
# - I've made the desk_handling_time generator a separate function. This means: we can experiment with changes when
# we want, it neatens things up inside the queue function (code as documentation once again!), and means just in case
# we ever need seed control e.g. for testing we can have access to it.
# - The desk_handling_time change also means we don't have to unpack all of those internal desks variables inside the 
# queue function. Again, useful if we ever want to change what desks information we store, we keep it modular and in
# get_desk_handling_time.
# - I've changed "C" to "P" for customers -> passengers.
# - I've added an optional random seed to the queue function
